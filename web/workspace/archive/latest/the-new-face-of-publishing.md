preface: If you’ve read a newspaper recently, chances are you’ve already read an article written by a computer. Automated news reporting is big business and just one way that data is changing the face of publishing.

Leading the charge is American company Automated Insights, whose patented Wordsmith platform produces plain English articles directly from their clients data. It’s not perfected and journalists shouldn’t be heading for the Job Centre quite yet, but already the platform is producing billions of articles for its clients including Yahoo! and Associated Press (AP).

AP’s adoption of automated reporting has led them to produce a vast number of stories that they would otherwise be unable to cover, such as college sports and earnings reports. Today Wordsmith works only with structured, quantitative data which, for now at least, remains their primary focus. In the future though we can expect companies to develop software that will go further, producing articles from unstructured documents, generating press releases, lengthy articles and insight documents. The LA Times has already given us a glimpse of this last year when they used custom software to [auto-generate a story](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/03/17/quakebot_los_angeles_times_robot_journalist_writes_article_on_la_earthquake.html) about an earthquake minutes after it happened.

Whilst we may be a few years away from a fully automated publishing economy, there is a number of ways that data has already changed the face of the publishing industry. Increasingly, publishing companies are using data insight to aid decision making. Many have established new departments for data analytics with planet-sized brained PhDs whose tasks involve crunching mountains of user data in order to establish actionable insights to improve business performance and customer experience. The scope of data being tracked and analysed is growing at an exponential rate.

Meredith Corp, publisher of mass market women’s magazines including Parenting & Better Homes currently has an average of 800 data points for each of their 115 million customers, which is double what they had five years ago. The more data being analysed, the more personalised the experience publishers can offer their readers. Whether that’s through content displayed, or through advertisements and emails. The more relevant the experience is to the consumer, the better the conversion will be.

In an age of declining revenue streams typically associated with publishing, data also offers publishing companies the opportunity to establish a new one. A number of publishers have already begun initiatives aimed at generating value out of their first-party data. Hearst’s Jumpstart Automotive group are using consumer data to provide valuable insights to their advertising partners. By using their first-party data in their advertising campaigns, Jumpstart offer their partners more efficient and effective campaigns that perform better.

By offering insight about how customers behave onsite in context of competitors, publishers can provide advertisers a level of insight that has not previously existed. Increasingly, first-party data like email and website analytics are becoming some of publishers’ most valuable assets.

These are just a few ways data is changing the face of publishing. Data has the potential to improve the publishing industry dramatically; making businesses more efficient, offering new revenue opportunities and improving customer experiences. Publishers who embrace and adopt new data-driven technologies will prosper. For the most part, those that do not will find it increasingly difficult to remain competitive.
