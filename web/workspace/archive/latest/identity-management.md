Individual identity is a complicated, ever evolving thing. Identities are at the same time personal, social, public and private. They frequently resist definition, seeming knowable at first glance, they break apart with further inspection.

Getting to know someone well takes time and effort. When you first meet someone, you ask a lot of questions to understand who they are and how to relate to them. Social context provides many cues for us, but it is only as a relationship deepens and shared experiences are created that the nuance of individual personalities reveal themselves to us.

In our personal lives our identities coalesce around our names. We might know something about who John is, but if we work with him, do we really know who he is when he's at home, at a bar with his friends, or what it’s really like in his mind?

According to [Frosh, Phoenix and Pattman](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0333779231/) (2002) an identity can be defined as:

> “something multiple and potentially fluid, constructed through experience and . . . [heavily dependent on] the surrounding socio-cultural environment . . . This is one reason why an individual may find it difficult to describe the sources and nature of her or his various identities”

When it comes to digital identity, we find ourselves in a whole new paradigm. The digital world gives us a new way in which to play with, explore, and share our identities. The main way that we do this is by way of our active digital identities. Active digital identities are distinguished from passive digital identities in that we control what we put out there. We are active in displaying our digital identity to the world in a variety of ways:

* Our profiles and posts on social networks like Facebook
* Our Tweets
* Professional networking sites such as LinkedIn
* Personal or professional websites
* Blogs
* The photos we choose to share on photography sites like Instagram
Selfies
* The fantasy identities we take up in gaming or in virtual realities
* But we are also passive bystanders, observing as aspects of an identity - if not exactly our identities - become available through search engines, producing a conglomeration of information about us that act together to create a passive online identity.

Expressions of passive online identities:

* The listing of results that arise against our own names in Google
* Photographs and comments that other identities post about us on social networks
* Information about us (accurate or not) that is collected and compiled by online aggregators
* Information about us that is placed online without our knowledge or consent
Personal information outside our control that appears online in a variety of ways
So what exactly constitutes an identity? Everything above. And much, much more.

Businesses working to build long-term relationships with their customers now find that they have overwhelming access to information and, because of that deluge, a complete lack of clarity as to the true nature of the individual.

It is critical that a relationship offers the right level of intimacy for the known identity of the individual. Knowing too little will result in wasted effort and misguided messages; knowing too much risks alienation.

It is because of this that understanding what constitutes digital identity is central to the creation of engaging experiences.

We believe that digital identity can be broken into five key layers, with increasing depth and complexity:

1. Core demographics
2. Actions
3. Affinity
4. Beliefs
5. Values


## 1. Core demographics

Core demographics can be loosely defined as observable characteristics, such as gender and age. It also includes social indicators, such as where a person lives, their financial status and the make up of their household.

This layer of identity is readily observable and generally available. We have all filled out forms with this information – at the doctor’s, the supermarket and pretty much daily online.

This is also the kind of information that must be used with care: it is a directional indicator, but does not guarantee that messaging or content based on it exclusively will connect positively with the individual. You would not expect every person who is the same age as you to be your friend. The same logic applies to core demographics.

## 2. Actions

Actions are the things that a person does. Actions more accurately reflect who an individual is because they are instigated and directed by the individual. Actions are a core component of identity because no one else can decide on an individuals actions apart from the individual.

Many individual actions are clear a reflection by a person's true identity. If the individual cares about their health, they may go to the gym three times a week. The motivation for a specific action is rooted in who the individual is.

Actions also shape identity. When you do something that you enjoy (like completing a scrapbook), the action is turned into a memory that reinforces a specific identity that you have about yourself. This can work for both positive and negative actions, which makes it a powerful reinforcement tool. Every time that an individual plays a game of five-a-side, they are reminded that they are sporty. Identity based on actions ties the individual to everyone else who as taken the action.

Actions influence reputation scores, such as the individuals credit score, Airbnb score or Facebook's social influence metrics.

Actions are driven by motivation, and motivation is the next layer of identity.

## 3. Affinity

Actions are driven by what an individual care about. Most of the time, individuals do things that they care about and don’t do things that they don’t care about. It is because of this that we consider affinity to be a deeper signifier of identity.

It is important to understand that people that take the same action do not necessarily care about the same things. In order to determine differences at this level, you must look deeper still.

## 4. Beliefs

With beliefs we start to see a very fundamental level of identity, and one that is almost unchanged throughout a lifetime. What a person believes in is formed by the cultural institutions that they participate in, and the narrative that they tell themselves about their lives.

To understand how beliefs impact identity, consider two new born children, one born in London and the other in rural Pakistan. In their first year of life, there is not much difference to their experience. But, as they get older, they speak different languages, take different courses in school, are exposed to different religions and are subject to different laws. Their parents have different work histories, and their homes are different.

You can see how these two individuals who start from the same position, come to have different beliefs based on their circumstances and experiences.

In order to understand an individual’s beliefs you have to have sight of wide array of indicators, from the magazines and newspapers that they read, to the public institutions they are affiliated with, to the types of charitable donations that they make.

## 5. Values

At the core of identity is the notion of values. An individuals values are built and reinforced by the other layers of identity and they drive the actions and decisions that the individual takes, consciously or unconsciously.

When a person tweets every regularly, they could be expressing that they value connecting with other people, or they could be expressing that they value being the centre of attention. Metrics are not enough to understand values: they must be interpreted to understand the driver of identity.

Managing identity

Managing identity with a clarity of understanding about what constitutes identity is a central tenant of the DADI+ platform. This allows us to map data into the user record from the right sources at the right time, and to play it back in a manner that enables intelligent content decisions, from eCRM tailoring to entirely bespoke experiences.

**We believe that understanding what constitutes an identity, and managing the individual record in order to maximise clarity through each of its component parts, is critical to creating engaging experiences. The deeper you are able to go in understanding what makes up an individual's identity, the stronger the relationship.**
