The focus returns to DADI Track and Visualise this week (week commencing 14th November 2016). The existing core products have all been largely static and isolated, Track is the first product to begin providing data points around user behaviour, enabling the rest of the stack to receive and act on information provided by Track.

exact match or case insensitive matching. Raised by Viktor due to a slower-than-expected query response in some instances (https://github.com/dadi/api/issues/147)
