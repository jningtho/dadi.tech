Development of version 2.0 of API has advanced a long way since the last update. The Datastore Plugin interface is almost solidified and a template for Datatore Plugin development will soon be available from DADI's GitHub.

A JSON file store joins the selection of datastores under development, in addition to the MongoDB and CouchDB datastores. The API test suite has been modified to remove references to MongoDB and currently has all tests passing against the file store datastore.
