CDN Version 1.7.0 is almost ready to be published, and should be available by the end of this week. A lot of development effort was put into the product last week to ensure the image upload and layout processor were stable.

Investigation was begun last week into an intermittent error in Web which displayed 401 errors when requesting data from API. The developers have tracked the issue down to a small piece of code in the API Wrapper module which would continue to reuse it's cached access token after API's tokenStore indexes were refreshed. API Wrapper is currently being updated to refresh it's token in the event of an 'invalid_token' response from API.
