Synchronous working is where team members regularly drop what they’re doing to meet and discuss next steps. They then get back to work, each spending 15 minutes trying to remember what they were doing before they stopped.

With asynchronous working, the whole team rarely meets for big discussions. Instead they each work on shared files/documents/artefacts, gradually adding layers and improvements.

Our developers do this all the time when adding to a repository of source code. We also do it when sharing online documents, with several of us editing and commenting as we go along.

People in the team usually have several work threads running at a time. So if they’re waiting on one they can always pick up another.

Asynchronous working means people can work the hours that suit them and put their lives first.

You can read more about it in this article on [how we work](/insight/how-we-work).
