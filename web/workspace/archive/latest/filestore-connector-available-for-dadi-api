The latest release of API Edge comes with the ability to use a JSON file as the backend.

The first release of API Edge introduced configurable database engine support, with MongoDB being the first connector available. A new connector is now available for using a JSON file the API backend.

### Try it out

To install the DADI API Edge, use the following command:

```bash
$ npm install @dadi/api@edge --save
```

### Install the filestore connector

```bash
$ npm install @dadi/api-filestore --save
```

### Add a configuration file

Add a filestore configuration file in the config directory of your project. The
file should be named using the format filestore.<environment>.json

#### Example configuration file for @dadi/api-filestore

File config/filestore.development.json

```json
{
  "database": {
    "path": "workspace/db",
    "autosaveInterval": 10000,
    "serializationMethod": "normal"
  }
}
```

Property | Description 
:--------|:------------
path | The relative or absolute path to where your database files will be stored 
autosaveInterval | The interval, in milliseconds, between database writes to disk 
serializationMethod | The format of the database file on disk. `normal` is a condensed version of the JSON, `pretty` is more readable 

### Modify API configuration

In previous versions we used a database block in the API configuration file to
tell API how to connect to the default MongoDB installation.

In API 2.0 and above, we specify a datastore as follows:

```json
{
  "server": {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 3001
  },
  "datastore": "@dadi/api-filestore",
  "auth": {
    "datastore": "@dadi/api-filestore",
    "database": "testdb"
  }
}
```
